implement a flutter android method channel in kotlin to do the following
["initiateCall", "getLastDialedNumber", "getCallLog", "clearCallLog"]

whenever a call is initiated using "initiateCall" method, the call should initiate
whenever "getLastDialedNumber" method is called, the last dialed number should be returned
whenever "getCallLog" method is called, the call log should be returned
whenever "clearCallLog" method is called, the call log should be cleared

getCallLog will return List<CallLogEntry> 
of type class CallLogEntry {
     String id;
     String number;
     String? contactName;
     DateTime? date;
     Duration? duration;
     bool isOutgoing;
}

initiateCall will take a String number as a parameter and return 0 if the call was initiated successfully and 1 if the call failed

getLastDialedNumber will return the last dialed number as a String

clearCallLog will clear the call log and return 0 if the call log was cleared successfully and throw an exception if the call log was not cleared successfully

the call log should be stored in a list of CallLogEntry objects
